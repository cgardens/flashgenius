Want to learn more faster and better?  This app is an adaptive flash-card app.  As you study, the app models your performance and learns about how you learn.  It tells you what you should study and when in order to learn in the most effecient manner possible.  In this way, you learn more in less time time and remember it for longer.  Happy learning!


##Longer Explanation:

There is a great deal of debate about how we remember, how we forget and why we do either.  There is the theory of decay, interference theory, trace decay theory, and many others.  While the exact mechanism is debated

[Name of app] models an individual user's performance on individual flash-cards across time.  The app tracks a user's answers, their certainty, when they reviewed the card, the order in which they viewed cards, and other relevant details.  Their answers are weighted by their certainty and then fed through multiple regression engines to predict three things:

1.) When the user will master the material at the current rate
2.) When is the optimal time to review the material to learn it in the most effecient way possible
3.) Once the material is mastered, when is the optimal time to review it to maintain the ability to recall it

Number 1 is accomplished by tracking the user performance on individual cards across time, weighing their results by their certainty, and then using these scores to calculate a deck-level performance score.  After enough of these scores have been collected we can then use regression fit techniques to find the best fit for the data and from this equation predict when the user will achieve mastery.

Number 2 uses the same data as number 1 but is   While there are different theories about the rate at which human knowledge decays, one of the oldest is that is decays at a logarithmic rate.  Using this idea as a basis..........  Finish...........

designed to help you learn more effeciently and effectively.  Choose a deck of cards (or make your own) and then go through it.  The app will track you answers and your certainty.  This data is used to score your performance and model when is the optimal time to review the deck and when, at the current rate, you will master the material.  By studying smarter you can learn more faster.






it at the current rate.


Browse through the colleciotn of decks and

It does this in a number of ways

First, every time you review a deck, your answer and your certainty regarding this answer are recorded.  This information is then analyzed by our servers to create a model of how you learn.  The more times you review the deck, the more accurate this model becomes.  As this model gets better and better it allows us suggest ways to optimize your learning process.  Using multiple regression models and curve fitting equations we can suggest optimal times to review the deck

OUr aim is to help users strengthen their memories as effectiently as possible.  Seeking out that point where we need to struggle a little to recall the information but not so long that
The test of all this is whether you, the user, find it helpful.
We think that the best time to review an a question

We give you the option of reviewing the entire deck, or just the cards you are still working to master.


There is a great deal of debate about the neurobiology of memory, why our memories fade, and in what ways it happens.

There are so many wonderful things to learn and so little time to do it.  This app
